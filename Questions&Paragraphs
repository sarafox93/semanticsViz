Data Structures:
  Data structures include the use of an array in python in order to sort thorugh all the information with the key 
  terms(selected holidays). By creating one array out of all the information the python script could look through each
  element and sort out information.

Will you add any data from the web?
	No more data from the web will be added as we are just searching through all the objects in the given JSON file.

Code:
	The code that transforms out data set from 100,000 objects is in the git repository.

Paragraph for why processing data a certain way:
	The data will be processed first by keywords in the user tags and machine tags specific to the preselected holidays.
	This will give us all the images that people have tagged with those keywords and then later the images will be processed 
	by geolocation. The geolocation will allow us to pinpoint where the photo was uploaded from, thus, creating the backbone 
	for our location portion of the application. Once the data is sorted by geolocation it will then again by sorted by date 
	uploaded. This will provide the final data filter in order for our application to work correctly. The application user 
	can now select a holiday and then a date around that holiday to display which geolocation(state) uploaded the most 
	pictures related to that holiday.
