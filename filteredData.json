He was taken into his father's firm, known as the William Pepperells, which dealt in lumber, fish, and shipbuilding. European products were imported for sale. Profits were invested in land, and by 1724 young William owned almost the entire townships of Sacco and Scarboro. Business often took him to Boston, where on March 16, 1724, he married Mary Hirt.\n\nPepperell was made a militia colonel in 1726, in command of all Maine militia. That same year he was elected to the Massachusetts General Court as a representative from Kittery, and the following year he became an assistant, or member of the council, a position he held until his death. For 18 years he served as president of the council. Although he had no legal training, Pepperell was appointed chief justice of Massachusetts in 1730. At his father's death in 1734 he inherited the bulk of his estate and in 1744 made his son Andrew a partner in the firm.\n\nIn 1745, when war broke out between England and France (the North American conflict is called King George's War), Pepperell was sent with 3, 000 or 4, 000 men to attack Ft. Louisbourg in Canada. On April 30, 1745, he joined the British fleet there. Displaying little military skill, Pepperell besieged the fort in almost comic-opera fashion, but the corrupt and inefficient French surrendered June 17. Pepperell's greatest forte was his popularity with the troops and his ability to get along with the naval officers. In 1746 he was created a baronet, the first native American ever so honored. In 1749 he was received by the King.\n\nBecause of extensive landholdings, Pepperell wound up his mercantile affairs. In 1753 he was on a commission to negotiate a treaty with the Maine Indians. At the outbreak of the French and Indian War, the Crown ordered him to raise 1, 000 men. Created a major general in 1755, Pepperell commanded the eastern frontier. In 1756, as president of the council, he acted as governor of Massachusetts. On Feb. 20, 1759, he was commissioned lieutenant colonel in the regular army, but because of failing health he took no further role in the war. He died that year on July 6.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.answers.com/topic/sir-william-pepperell\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.answers.com/topic/sir-william-pepperell</a>","userTags":["1696","1733","1759","building","chimney","colonial","dwelling","fence","gambrel","gray","grey","historic","house","kittery","lord","maine","me","national register of historic places","pepperell","point","road","rte 103","street","william","york"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.774},{"tag":"building","confidence":0.774},{"tag":"house","confidence":0.774},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.951}],"geo":{"longtitude":-70.702729,"latitude":43.083268,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/36783643@N05/3517404415/","downloadUrl":"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3560/3517404415_9f26db8454.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[{"commentId":"36778303-3517404415-72157623939618143","userId":"41324237@N07","nickname":"Louise and Colin","dateCreated":1273914638000,"content":"An interesting building nicely photographed."},{"commentId":"36778303-3517404415-72157623939835339","userId":"36229575@N06","nickname":"~~BC's~~Photographs~~","dateCreated":1273918692000,"content":"Great history lesson and capture of this old house well done Nancy!\n\nThank You For Posting This In:\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/our_group/pool/\"><img src=\"http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4006/4463637427_cf7f2eebcf_t.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"77\" alt=\"May I help You\" /></a><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/our_group/pool/\">\nThis Group Of Our Own</a>"},{"commentId":"36778303-3517404415-72157623939963023","userId":"7363978@N05","nickname":"pet_aud","dateCreated":1273920963000,"content":"Please add the name of the village to the title or description - see group rules( #3)\nSeen in \n<img src=\"http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3109/2361176788_8e087aaba7_s.jpg\" /><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://flickr.com/groups/world_villages/\">[Villages_and_small_towns_of_the_world]</a>"},{"commentId":"36778303-3517404415-72157623942597347","userId":"36783643@N05","nickname":"InAweofGod'sCreation","dateCreated":1273953548000,"content":"Sorry Per aud.

My photos are FREE for anyone to use, just give me credit and it would be nice if you let me know, thanks - NONE OF MY PICTURES ARE HDR.\n\nThe is without a doubt the most well known lighthouse in Canada and one of the most photographed lighthouses in the world, the history of the light at Peggy's Cove is little known. Various versions account for the name. Peggy is the nickname for Margaret and the community may have acquired the name from nearby Saint Margaret's Bay, especially as the point marks the eastern entrance to the bay. Other accounts suggest Peggy was an early settler. A popular romantic version says a woman named Peggy was the only survivor of a shipwreck and there are even American families that claim descent from the shipwrecked Peggy.\n\nIt was decided to erect a light to mark the eastern entrance to St. Margaret's Bay in 1868. While best known as \"the Peggy's Cove Lighthouse\", it was and remains, officially know as the Peggy's Point Lighthouse as its purpose is to mark the point, not the cove. The cove has its own small light on the government wharf. The first lighthouse was a wooden tower, built atop a keeper's dwelling at the point. It was a red light and used a catoptric reflector (a round silver-plated mirror) to magnify the kerosene oil lamp. The wooden tower, built atop a keeper's dwelling was replaced by the present tower in 1915, a pleasing and stout concrete octagon 15.24 meters (50ft) west of the original light. The keeper's dwelling remained for many years nearby as did a tall flagpole displaying coded black cones and balls to warn of bad weather approaching. The new lighthouse showed a white light from a dioptric lens, a series of glass prisms, to magnify the light. Several colour and character changes followed, the most recent being the change from white to green and then to red.","userTags":["18-200 di iii vc","archer10","canada","dennis","dennis g. jarvis","dennis jarvis","free","free picture","i am canadian","jarvis","nex-7","nova scotia","sony","wbnaw_cn_ns"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.74},{"tag":"bay","confidence":0.705},{"tag":"boat","confidence":0.765},{"tag":"cliff diving","confidence":0.502},{"tag":"cliff","confidence":0.511},{"tag":"coast","confidence":0.84},{"tag":"harbor","confidence":0.713},{"tag":"lake","confidence":0.652},{"tag":"landscape","confidence":0.84},{"tag":"lighthouse","confidence":0.74},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.958},{"tag":"ocean","confidence":0.512},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.986},{"tag":"rock formation","confidence":0.593},{"tag":"rock","confidence":0.593},{"tag":"sail boat","confidence":0.608},{"tag":"sea","confidence":0.958},{"tag":"seaside","confidence":0.676},{"tag":"serene","confidence":0.78},{"tag":"shore","confidence":0.84},{"tag":"sport","confidence":0.502},{"tag":"swim","confidence":0.502},{"tag":"tower","confidence":0.74},{"tag":"vehicle","confidence":0.765},{"tag":"water sport","confidence":0.502},{"tag":"water","confidence":0.855},{"tag":"waterfront","confidence":0.713}],"geo":{"longtitude":-63.919486,"latitude":44.491484,"accuracy":13},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/22490717@N02/7611978190/","downloadUrl":"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8021/7611978190_d6236626b1.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

These include the Great Temple and other ceremonial mounds, a burial mound, and defensive trenches. They represented highly skilled engineering techniques and soil knowledge, and the organization of many laborers. The site has evidence of \"17,000 years of continuous human habitation.\" The 702-acre (2.84 km2) park is located on the east bank of the Ocmulgee River. Present-day Macon, Georgia developed around the site after the United States built Fort Benjamin Hawkins nearby in 1806.\n \nVarying cultures of prehistoric indigenous peoples settled on what is called the Macon Plateau at the Fall Line, where the rolling hills of the Piedmont met the Atlantic Coastal Plain. The monument designation includes the Lamar Mounds and Village Site, located downriver about three miles (5 km) from Macon. The monument park was designated for federal protection by the National Park Service (NPS) in 1934.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocmulgee_National_Monument\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocmulgee_National_Monument</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>","userTags":[""],"machineTags":[{"tag":"field","confidence":0.929},{"tag":"foothill","confidence":0.606},{"tag":"grass","confidence":0.829},{"tag":"grassland","confidence":0.929},{"tag":"hay","confidence":0.518},{"tag":"hill","confidence":0.737},{"tag":"landscape","confidence":0.956},{"tag":"meadow","confidence":0.726},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.956},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.99},{"tag":"pasture","confidence":0.929},{"tag":"plain","confidence":0.956},{"tag":"plant","confidence":0.829},{"tag":"steppe","confidence":0.71}],"geo":{"longtitude":-83.608403,"latitude":32.836931,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75683070@N00/5810897675/","downloadUrl":"http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3329/5810897675_482bf78382.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

Most land in the mountains is owned by the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management and managed as the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area and Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area within the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest.\n\nThe Spring Mountains range is named for the number of springs to be found, many of them in the recesses of Red Rock, which is on the eastern side of the mountains. The Spring Mountains divide the Pahrump Valley and Amargosa River basins from the Las Vegas Valley watershed, which drains into the Colorado River watershed, by way of Las Vegas Wash into Lake Mead, thus the mountains define part of the boundary of the Great Basin. The Great Basin Divide, (one of the Great Basin region borders) continues north through the Indian Springs Pass region then turns due east at the perimeter mountain ranges north of Las Vegas.\n\nhe highest point is Mount Charleston, at 11,918 ft (3,633 m). The area around Mt. Charleston is protected in the Mount Charleston Wilderness. The area is typically 20-30 degrees Fahrenheit (11-17 degrees Celsius) cooler than the valleys below, and it is a popular getaway for Las Vegas residents and visitors. The Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort lies in Lee Canyon on State Highway 156.\n\nThe Spring Mountains are a sky island ecosystem. With an area of about 860 square miles (2,200 km2), and a vertical range of nearly 2 miles (3.2 km), the mountains encompass a wide variety of habitats, and the biological diversity is probably greater than anywhere else in Nevada. 37 species of trees are known (more than any other Nevadan range), and 600 species of vascular plants have been reported from the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area alone.\n \nThe bases of the mountains are part of the Mojave Zone dominated by creosote bush and white bursage, then rising to a Blackbrush Zone, followed by a Pygmy Conifer Zone with juniper, pinyon pine and mountain-mahogany, and topped by a montane zone with many species of conifers around Mt. Charleston and its connecting ridges.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Mountains\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Mountains</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>","userTags":[""],"machineTags":[{"tag":"alp","confidence":0.967},{"tag":"arete","confidence":0.925},{"tag":"bluff","confidence":0.692},{"tag":"cliff","confidence":0.911},{"tag":"crag","confidence":0.911},{"tag":"escarpment","confidence":0.897},{"tag":"foothill","confidence":0.707},{"tag":"glacier","confidence":0.699},{"tag":"hill","confidence":0.981},{"tag":"landscape","confidence":0.991},{"tag":"mountain peak","confidence":0.943},{"tag":"mountain ridge","confidence":0.898},{"tag":"mountain","confidence":0.979},{"tag":"mountainside","confidence":0.976},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.991},{"tag":"outcrop","confidence":0.954},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.992},{"tag":"ridge","confidence":0.991},{"tag":"rock formation","confidence":0.954},{"tag":"rock","confidence":0.954},{"tag":"slope","confidence":0.976}],"geo":{"longtitude":-115.678009,"latitude":36.306708,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75683070@N00/8646547725/","downloadUrl":"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8257/8646547725_e81f8b6529.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

We got there just in time for the clouds to turn pink. We hoped that it would develop into a better sunrise, but it turned out we got the best light right when we got there.  If you're looking for something a little different than the usual stuff around Chicago, this is a nice place to practice these types of shots.\n \n<strong>The Photographer's Ephemeris</strong>\nI want to thank my parents, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and my wife for all of the Apple gift cards for my birthdays and Christmas over the past year.  I saved up enough of them for my first iPad and I am loving it.\nLast night before heading out, I tried an app called <a href=\"http://photoephemeris.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Photographer's Ephemeris</a> for the iPad. You can select any location in the world and it will show you the exact direction that the sun and moon will rise and set for any day of the year.  You could use this to figure out where you would need to be standing to get the moon to rise directly over a given subject. For this morning's shoot, I learned that the sun would rise out over the lake (duh), but I can see this coming in handy in the future.Read more at <a href=\"http://www.outofchicago.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.outofchicago.com</a>","userTags":["beach","clouds","dock street","evanston","grosse point lighthouse","illinois","lake michigan","lighthouse park district","long exposure","pier","pink sky","posts","runied","sunrise","water"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.545},{"tag":"beach","confidence":0.593},{"tag":"bright","confidence":0.674},{"tag":"city","confidence":0.545},{"tag":"cityscape","confidence":0.545},{"tag":"dusk","confidence":0.87},{"tag":"ferry","confidence":0.542},{"tag":"fog","confidence":0.506},{"tag":"harbor","confidence":0.837},{"tag":"lake","confidence":0.769},{"tag":"lakefront","confidence":0.779},{"tag":"landscape","confidence":0.779},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.856},{"tag":"night","confidence":0.62},{"tag":"ocean","confidence":0.506},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.942},{"tag":"pier","confidence":0.851},{"tag":"river","confidence":0.511},{"tag":"romantic","confidence":0.564},{"tag":"sea","confidence":0.856},{"tag":"seaside","confidence":0.63},{"tag":"serene","confidence":0.9},{"tag":"ship","confidence":0.542},{"tag":"shore","confidence":0.63},{"tag":"skyline","confidence":0.771},{"tag":"sunlight","confidence":0.887},{"tag":"sunrise","confidence":0.594},{"tag":"sunset","confidence":0.896},{"tag":"symmetry","confidence":0.664},{"tag":"vehicle","confidence":0.542},{"tag":"water","confidence":0.862},{"tag":"waterfront","confidence":0.837}],"geo":{"longtitude":-87.675569,"latitude":42.065973,"accuracy":15},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/65315936@N00/6995448955/","downloadUrl":"http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6050/6995448955_a074f2b1b8.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"46870239@N06","nickname":"Sunset Snapper","dateFavorited":1434911227000},{"userId":"118074396@N06","nickname":"snejana.iordanova","dateFavorited":1432760630000},{"userId":"131153866@N07","nickname":"tjwilkes5","dateFavorited":1425591266000},{"userId":"125027088@N06","nickname":"David W.

Suffice to say that it is a very small percentage of introduced organisms in most regions that would be considered invasive, typically between 5% and 10%.\r\n\r\nAnd happy belated new year! :-)"},{"commentId":"300639-251980940-72157594306661190","userId":"61897811@N00","nickname":"Anita363","dateCreated":1159674203000,"content":"Actually, I would love to know about that (have been wondering for a long time): why the heck are cabbage whites so successful---what have they got that native butterflies haven't got---and have they displaced native species?"},{"commentId":"300639-251980940-72157594376917771","userId":"24608578@N00","nickname":"tigerbeatlefreak","dateCreated":1163562033000,"content":"A beautiful micro!

What is really interesting is that I've noted that in northwestern Wisconsin Pieris napi swarms around the same host that is occupied by P. virginiensis in northeastern WI.

Much of the history and capabilities of the Blackbird remain shrouded in mystery, but what has emerged makes this one of the most fascinating aircraft ever flown.\n\n\nThe Blackbird evolved from an earlier aircraft, known as the A-12. The A-12 was flown by the CIA and was almost identical to the SR-71, except that it was a single seat version. The SR-71 was developed by Lockheed's \" Skunk Works\" in the early 60's by key designer and pilot, the legendary Clarence \"Kelly\" Johnson. The first aircraft was delivered to SAC in 1964.\n\n\nThe SR-71's mission was reconnaissance and it carried no armament. It filled its role exceedingly well and, from 1964 until 1990, played a vital role in protecting our nation's security. In any crisis, anywhere in the world and at any time, the crews and maintainers of the Blackbird supported missions directed by the highest levels of our nation's government. To this end, SR-71's were based at Beale Air Force Base, California and at two forward operating locations in Okinawa and the United Kingdom.\n\n\nMade of Titanium, the SR-71 fuselage heats to 500 degrees during flight and elongates 6 inches. The SR-71 was capable of speeds of over three times the speed of sound and altitudes of over 85,000 feet, but these are just the published figures. The actual performance was greater in both categories. There were 32 SR-71's built and in 26 years of service, no aircraft was ever lost to hostile fire, despite the fact that they were shot at over 1,000 times.\n\n\nDue to U. S. Government budgetary cutbacks in military spending, the end to most Communist threats in Eastern Europe, and advancements in satellite reconnaissance, the SR-71 was retired in 1990. At this time, three aircraft were delivered to NASA for high altitude experiments. The most notable was one SR-71 that was delivered to the Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. that recorded the flight from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C. in 68 minutes.\n\n\nThe aircraft on display at Castle, flew the most operational missions of any SR-71 and was the first to fly over Vietnam.

Not like the other Christmases, though... \nAs a good practice, I often deliberately make myself bask in the beauty of simple moments. I do this several times throughout the day. For example, tonight we watched a movie on a projector outside. We pulled up the trampoline and laid under the stars, there was a cool breeze, there was beer. All of this came together so gradually, so naturally, that I failed to sense that anything out of the ordinary was happening. But while we were laying on the trampoline outside under the stars watching a movie, it suddenly dawned on me... THIS is what I've been chasing after for months now! THIS little moment is the kind of memory that I have been aching to make. And when it actually happens, it is hard to KNOW that it is happening. When we are in the midst of a moment that we will one day look back on, we often do not acknowledge their worth. It is only much later that we think back and realize how special that time was. \nThere are moments in life that should be treated with the same connoisseurial appreciation of a fine wine... sniffed, felt, tasted, and savored for all it has to offer. There is no going back, so moments must be appreciated as they are happening. If I can learn to recognize when I am actively making a memory that I will look back on, I can savor it as I did tonight. I can tell myself: \"This is beautiful, this is beautiful...\"\nI will remember tonight. I don't know where I will be in life when I recall this evening with fondness, but I know that on this night, while I'm here... I am in a good place.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Drew-Bandy-Fauxtography/127565627304042\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"http://www.drewbandy.com/\" target=\"blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a>","userTags":["2.8","35-70mm","365","australia","barbecue","bbq","christmas","cookout","d200","geraldton","grill","merry christmas","nikon","project365"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"alcohol","confidence":0.712},{"tag":"beverage","confidence":0.712},{"tag":"coffee","confidence":0.656},{"tag":"depth of field","confidence":0.533},{"tag":"fire","confidence":0.508},{"tag":"flame","confidence":0.508},{"tag":"food","confidence":0.712},{"tag":"indoor","confidence":0.985},{"tag":"text","confidence":0.524},{"tag":"wine","confidence":0.506},{"tag":"writing","confidence":0.524}],"geo":{"longtitude":114.626197,"latitude":-28.77458,"accuracy":11},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/51980416@N03/5290674410/","downloadUrl":"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5284/5290674410_182d087e89.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[{"commentId":"51957362-5290674410-72157625676854058","userId":"37497982@N05","nickname":"ejpphotography","dateCreated":1293384165000,"content":"love it and the story.  :)  Merry Christmas Drew."}]},

Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah, Winter Solstice, Festivus, Kwanzaa and whatever else you may celebrate! :)","userTags":["bokeh","christmas tree","disney","disneyland","gibson girl ice cream parlor","ice cream","ice cream parlor","main street","main street usa","sign","window"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"alcohol","confidence":0.812},{"tag":"alley","confidence":0.508},{"tag":"beer","confidence":0.726},{"tag":"beverage","confidence":0.828},{"tag":"bokeh","confidence":0.885},{"tag":"bright","confidence":0.916},{"tag":"circuit","confidence":0.577},{"tag":"circuitry","confidence":0.607},{"tag":"coffee","confidence":0.828},{"tag":"computer circuit","confidence":0.577},{"tag":"depth of field","confidence":0.939},{"tag":"electronics","confidence":0.607},{"tag":"food","confidence":0.828},{"tag":"handmade","confidence":0.727},{"tag":"night","confidence":0.563},{"tag":"quirky","confidence":0.785},{"tag":"sign","confidence":0.832},{"tag":"street sign","confidence":0.669},{"tag":"tea","confidence":0.672},{"tag":"text","confidence":0.93},{"tag":"texture","confidence":0.534},{"tag":"wine","confidence":0.812},{"tag":"writing","confidence":0.914}],"geo":{"longtitude":-117.919097,"latitude":33.811209,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/7816113@N07/6546804769/","downloadUrl":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7008/6546804769_d635f3aeed.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"23897848@N03","nickname":"iomoo","dateFavorited":1401528675000},{"userId":"9077088@N02","nickname":"k009034","dateFavorited":1388908067000},{"userId":"109118744@N07","nickname":"Evelyn Gray","dateFavorited":1384829389000},{"userId":"20250562@N02","nickname":"Bald_Jedi","dateFavorited":1372728306000},{"userId":"9164884@N05","nickname":"J Keller","dateFavorited":1372154294000},{"userId":"77479203@N08","nickname":"krismtux","dateFavorited":1357176582000},{"userId":"23623316@N04","nickname":"Uncle_Tom_1138","dateFavorited":1335052846000},{"userId":"23322134@N02","nickname":"Express Monorail","dateFavorited":1326039685000},{"userId":"63965618@N00","nickname":"Kitten Moon","dateFavorited":1325484419000},{"userId":"37733488@N00","nickname":"cindy251978","dateFavorited":1325000609000},{"userId":"18229944@N04","nickname":"lloydpick","dateFavorited":1324852561000},{"userId":"7544906@N03","nickname":"i_still_believe_in_u","dateFavorited":1324499420000},{"userId":"51903736@N00","nickname":"Lightning Bug Creek","dateFavorited":1324450580000},{"userId":"27467292@N03","nickname":"Arielle.Nadel","dateFavorited":1324439355000},{"userId":"82714086@N00","nickname":"Ring of Fire Hot Sauce 1","dateFavorited":1324435952000}],"comments":[{"commentId":"7794783-6546804769-72157628506197741","userId":"82714086@N00","nickname":"Ring of Fire Hot Sauce 1","dateCreated":1324435948000,"content":"Oh Baby!

I kept thinking... the sim is going to crash... the sim is going to crash. It didn't.\n\nI never found out who the DJ was, though we asked several times both in English and in Spanish... there was just too many people, chat lag and who knows what else. But oh wow, I had a blast there.\n\nThen, it was off to <a href=\"http://slurl.com/secondlife/Happy Clam Island/81/128/33\">Organica</a>, of course! Avies were dressed to the hilt with nods to popular Halloween icons. My angel sported his wings and so did many in the crowd. Andy Moon was there dancing with the crowd and he joined me and Xavier for a psy ball dance! Super fun!\n\nMy last stop for the night was <a href=\"http://slurl.com/secondlife/Dance Island/115/220/22\">Dance Island</a>. I had to go in to say hello to all.

The river drains a large section of central Illinois, with a drainage basin of 28,070 square miles (72,701 km2). This river was important among Native Americans and early French traders as the principal water route connecting the Great Lakes with the Mississippi. The French colonial settlements along the river formed the heart of the area known as the Illinois Country. After the construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal and the Hennepin Canal in the 19th century, the role of the river as link between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi was extended into the era of modern industrial shipping.\n\nThe Illinois River is formed by the confluence of the Kankakee River and the Des Plaines River in eastern Grundy County, approximately 10 miles (16 km) southwest of Joliet. This river flows west across northern Illinois, passing Morris and Ottawa, where it is joined by the Mazon River and Fox River. At LaSalle, the Illinois River is joined by the Vermilion River, and then it then flows west past Peru, IL, and Spring Valley. In southeastern Bureau County it turns south at an area known as the \"Great Bend,\" flowing southwest across western Illinois, past Lacon, Henry and downtown Peoria, the chief city on the river.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_River\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_River</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>","userTags":["new jersey day 1"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"aerial","confidence":0.968},{"tag":"art","confidence":0.511},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.54},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.928},{"tag":"text","confidence":0.564}],"geo":{"longtitude":-90.279389,"latitude":40.149545,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75683070@N00/7235195738/","downloadUrl":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7225/7235195738_21ee6f4c33.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

It was once known as Bedell's or Biddle's Mill after the name of an early owner. In 1727 it was described as High Water Mill. The current building dates from 1771 and was restored in 1969.  As early as 1755, the mill was leased by Matthew Boulton, one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution and leading figure in the Lunar Society, for scientific experimentation. It is believed he converted the machinery for use in metal working. As well as milling grain it has been used for grinding bones for fertiliser, metal rolling (Matthew Boulton) and wire drawing.  J. R. R. Tolkien lived within 300 yards of the mill between the ages four and eight, and would have seen it from his house. He has also said that he used the mill as a location in The Lord of the Rings.  \n\n<a href=\"http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=216971&resourceID=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sarehole Mill - Heritage Gateway</a>","userTags":["bedell's mill","biddle's mill","birmingham","birmingham city council","birmingham museums","cole bank rd","england","fertiliser","grade ii listed","grade ii listed building","grade ii listed watermill","great britain","grinding bones","hall green","high water mill","industrial revolution","lunar society","machinery","matthew boulton","metal rolling","metal working","mill","milling grain","misty","museum","previous pool","river cole","sarehole","sarehole mill","scientific experimentation","snow","the lord of the rings","united kingdom","watermill","west midlands","winter","wire drawing"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.917},{"tag":"building","confidence":0.917},{"tag":"chalet","confidence":0.63},{"tag":"gable roof","confidence":0.538},{"tag":"gable","confidence":0.569},{"tag":"hall","confidence":0.634},{"tag":"house","confidence":0.917},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.937},{"tag":"roof","confidence":0.538}],"geo":{"longtitude":-1.856013,"latitude":52.434272,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/39415781@N06/4212611049/","downloadUrl":"http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4057/4212611049_2364a1424b.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

I heard it all and then some. \n\nI love music of all kinds. If it's good, it's worth listening to, so don't start with the nose-up-in-the-air over your favorite genre. Believe me... good music will always find an audience. An audience of sophisticated listeners will stop to listen to any good sound... even if it isn't part of your normal repertoire.\n\nWhat is amazing is that dj's and musicians around the world know this, and they borrow from all genres to create their own personal sounds.\n\nHere in Second Life, we get the results from around the world.

The gardens are now run by the Curator William Dyson, assisted by one full time gardener, 2 part time gardeners and a small team of volunteers.\n\nSurrounding an early 17th Century Manor The garden extends to 7 acres, with many beautiful and rare shrubs, perennials and other hardy and half hardy plants. This remarkable Kent Garden is a veritable plantsman's paradise. The year begins with Snowflakes & Helleborus, followed by Magnolias, Azaleas and Rhododendrons.\n\nSummer brings a wealth of colourful, rare & exotic shrubs & perennials, especially Salvias; These unusual and long flowering plants are particularly well represented at Great Comp with their display extending between May & October.\n\nFor more information please visit <a href=\"http://www.greatcompgarden.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.greatcompgarden.co.uk/</a>","userTags":["awesomeblossoms","blue","breathtakers!","britain","england","flowers","flowersarebeautiful","garden","greatcompgarden","green","kent","leaves","salvia","travelsofhomerodyssey","uk","vosplusbellesphotos","wonderful world of flowers"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"animal","confidence":0.573},{"tag":"balloon flower","confidence":0.924},{"tag":"bird","confidence":0.573},{"tag":"blue","confidence":0.995},{"tag":"flower","confidence":0.924},{"tag":"indigo","confidence":0.931},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.924},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.982},{"tag":"plant","confidence":0.924},{"tag":"purple","confidence":0.973}],"geo":{"longtitude":0.324824,"latitude":51.288967,"accuracy":15},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/8525214@N06/4069178406/","downloadUrl":"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2583/4069178406_48e7c03bdd.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"95855108@N06","nickname":"G ..Thank you for the millions & millions of views","dateFavorited":1439286440000},{"userId":"60477765@N05","nickname":"Behappyaveiro","dateFavorited":1434811208000},{"userId":"50969511@N02","nickname":"Steve Taylor (Photography)","dateFavorited":1423887258000},{"userId":"114346088@N06","nickname":"Leticia Grandfils","dateFavorited":1410800582000},{"userId":"95549746@N08","nickname":"Joeflextech","dateFavorited":1404469562000},{"userId":"40449265@N06","nickname":"luciana814","dateFavorited":1260127816000},{"userId":"34945079@N05","nickname":"hawkeyefuller","dateFavorited":1259776431000},{"userId":"24437795@N04","nickname":"Sweet witch","dateFavorited":1257410262000},{"userId":"87453322@N00","nickname":"Rana Pipiens","dateFavorited":1257317635000},{"userId":"89804062@N00","nickname":"eepeirson (slowly back)","dateFavorited":1257265536000},{"userId":"44263873@N08","nickname":"irelandkat","dateFavorited":1257249951000},{"userId":"8156320@N03","nickname":"Geo_grafics","dateFavorited":1257220486000},{"userId":"67832671@N00","nickname":"donsutherland1","dateFavorited":1257215879000},{"userId":"8709142@N05","nickname":"swt snookie","dateFavorited":1257214910000},{"userId":"78976934@N00","nickname":"Martin-James","dateFavorited":1257190515000},{"userId":"21861018@N00","nickname":"bill barber","dateFavorited":1257188686000},{"userId":"36823892@N05","nickname":"Julka2009...(mostly off)","dateFavorited":1257184768000},{"userId":"61169667@N00","nickname":"alfiogreen","dateFavorited":1257182045000}],"comments":[{"commentId":"8479892-4069178406-72157622593919355","userId":"72181661@N00","nickname":"marty_pinker","dateCreated":1257182189000,"content":"Bloomin' brilliant blue!"},{"commentId":"8479892-4069178406-72157622718350724","userId":"8525214@N06","nickname":"antonychammond","dateCreated":1257182694000,"content":"Many thanks Marty and alfiogreen for adding this as a favorite...."},{"commentId":"8479892-4069178406-72157622594226559","userId":"36823892@N05","nickname":"Julka2009...(mostly off)","dateCreated":1257184817000,"content":"Amazing blue;

Named after St. Luke, the physician evangelist, in recognition of the Village's role as a refuge from yellow fever epidemics, the Episcoal church was organized in 1820.  One of the founding wardens was Clement Clarke Moore, a gentleman scholar of biblical Hebrew and Greek who also penned \"Twas the night before Christmas.\"  The cornerstone was laid in 1821 and the Church was consecrated on Ascension Day, May 16, 1822.  In the 19th century, St. Luke's was a center of the Catholic renewal and the Oxford Movement. The parish became the first in the city to offer daily services of the Divine Office and a weekly Sunday Eucharist.  In 1891, St. Luke's became a chapel of Trinity Church, which divested it in 1976.  \n\nBefore the island was widened by landfill, the church stood at the edge of the Hudson River surrounded by farms, streams and shaded country lanes. It was often accessed by boat in the days when the Village flourished as a country retreat for Manhattanites whose winter abodes were located further to the south. Its modest architectural expression reflects its function as a country chapel.  St. Luke's enclosed its garden and burial grounds with seven Federal townhouses.  Although a 1958 renovation allowed for the demolition of several of the row houses and the construction of a modern school, St. Luke's retains its insular, pastoral character. In 1981, the church was carefully restored after a serious fire.","userTags":["anglo-catholic","catholic","church","downtown","episcopal","garden","gothamist","greenwich village","manhattan","new york","new york city","ny","nyc","st. luke","st. luke in the fields","the church of st. luke in the fields","village","west village"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.643},{"tag":"building","confidence":0.643},{"tag":"farmhouse","confidence":0.643},{"tag":"house","confidence":0.643},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.638},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.973},{"tag":"plant","confidence":0.638},{"tag":"tree","confidence":0.638}],"geo":{"longtitude":-74.006776,"latitude":40.732336,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/70323761@N00/371221190/","downloadUrl":"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/180/371221190_b784232d25.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"10485077@N06","nickname":"edenpictures","dateFavorited":1256526406000},{"userId":"24095091@N04","nickname":"EllenOTHERphotos","dateFavorited":1218341645000},{"userId":"7158271@N06","nickname":"rangers681.1111","dateFavorited":1216054750000},{"userId":"75992846@N00","nickname":"George Vye","dateFavorited":1170298206000}],"comments":[{"commentId":"1713009-371221190-72157594511539548","userId":"75992846@N00","nickname":"George Vye","dateCreated":1170298253000,"content":"The memory of dear Father Flye"},{"commentId":"1713009-371221190-72157600142449215","userId":"18743009@N00","nickname":"Jumpin Jiminy","dateCreated":1177707548000,"content":"It's wonderful to see the history of the buildings."}]},

Going more quickly now, because I'm just retracing back the way I came before. Back on the trail, Mono Pass behind me, I'm heading south again down the side of the mountain, the green vegetation below coming back into view as I go.  \n\n<b>Mono Pass Trail Hike, Little Lakes Valley, California.</b>  Located about a half an hour from Bishop, the Little Lakes Valley is one of the easiest access points to the High Sierra in California.  Turning off from Highway 395 at the junction of Tom's Place, a paved road leads straight up into the mountains, terminating at a place in the John Muir Wilderness called Mosquito Flat just over 10,000 feet in elevation (one of the highest elevation paved roads in the state).  From here, you can take the relatively easy hike among the glacier-carved lakes along the Little Lakes Valley and Rock Creek.  Or, you can take the more challenging paths, up into the mountains.\n\nFrom the trailhead at the valley floor, the trail follows along Rock Creek for the first half mile, until you reach a junction, turning left abruptly up along the flanks of Mount Starr.  Climbing steadily for the next mile up to 11,000 feet, where a small spur leads off to Ruby Lake, situated at the very edge of the treeline.  The trail then turns left again, heading around the southern edge of Mount Starr, climbing higher and getting more rugged with each step.\n\nTurning northward, leaving the last of the hardy vegetation behind, it's a landscape of greys and browns, bare rock and lichens.  Finally passing over the wide saddle of Mono Pass at 12,000 feet at the 3 1/4 mile mark, it's like a moonscape.  Even at this extreme elevation, this is one of the more easily accessible path over the nearly-impassable Inconsolable Range of mountains, and this pass has been used for centuries by Indian tribes and (later) explorers.  Yet it is only snow-free for a few short months during the late summer and early fall.\n\nFrom here, the trail levels out, dropping slightly to Summit Lake half a mile to the north - a clear blue snow-fed depression at 11,900 feet.  From here, the trail continues along the western slopes of the Sierra Crest, first to a little cirque called Fourth Recess, then into Pioneer Basin - far too remote for a day hike and reserved for only the dedicated backpackers.  I turned around and returned back along the Mono Pass Trail, down to Ruby Lake and then back to the Little Lakes Valley.  Sunburned and exhausted but satisfied to have explored this remote corner of California.\n\nThis is a popular place to hike, and there are plenty of other photographs of the region by others on the internet.

Designed in the neo-Gothic style by William Craine and Thomas England, it was built primarily by Chinese laborers.\n\nOld Saint Mary's was replaced as a cathedral in 1891 by the first Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption at Van Ness and O'Farrell, but retained its name as a parish church.  The church managed to survive the 1906 earthquake, only to be gutted by a fire the next day, leaving only the outer walls and bell tower.  On June 20, 1909, Archbishop Riordan rededicated a renovated Old St. Mary's, with minimally changed lines and several structural improvements.  In 1929, in response to a growing population, another fifty feet were added to the sturcture and the sanctuary was extended enabling the addition of a sacristy, three chapels and a transept.  An enlarged seating capacity of over 2,000 made Old St. Mary's the largest church of the time in San Francisco. Beneath the church, a 500 seat auditorium with a stage was constructed. \n\nSan Francisco Landmark No. 2","userTags":["bay area","california","cathedral","chinatown","church","landmark","old cathedral of saint mary of the immaculate conception","old cathedral of st. mary of the immaculate conception","old saint mary's","old saint mary's cathedral","old saint mary's church","old saint mary's roman catholic church","old st. mary's","old st. mary's cathedral","old st. mary's church","old st. mary's roman catholic church","roman catholic","saint ambrose","san francisco","san francisco landmark","san francisco landmarks preservation advisory board","san francisco-bay area","sf","st. ambrose","stained glass","stained glass window"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"amusement park","confidence":0.726},{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.699},{"tag":"art","confidence":0.984},{"tag":"black background","confidence":0.525},{"tag":"black","confidence":0.525},{"tag":"handmade","confidence":0.783},{"tag":"indoor","confidence":0.694},{"tag":"night","confidence":0.544},{"tag":"photo border","confidence":0.782},{"tag":"picture frame","confidence":0.752},{"tag":"quirky","confidence":0.571},{"tag":"stained glass","confidence":0.984},{"tag":"surreal","confidence":0.861},{"tag":"urban decay","confidence":0.574},{"tag":"window","confidence":0.699}],"geo":{"longtitude":-122.40577,"latitude":37.792869,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/70323761@N00/6950666083/","downloadUrl":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7041/6950666083_fc78cfb5e2.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"37354576@N03","nickname":"mapimi","dateFavorited":1370730522000}],"comments":[]},

DC's version of this tradition is part of a series of coordinated concerts across North America called <a href=\"http://www.salutetovienna.com/\"><em>Salute to Vienna</em></a> and it's held at the <a href=\"http://www.kennedy-center.org/\">John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts</a> a few days after New Year's.  This year it was held tonight and I went.\n\nI'd never been to this before, but I'd been wanting to for a while.  It's not just a classical music concert, it's a sort of performing arts sampler platter.  In addition to the philharmonic part (btw, if your last name is Harmonic then I think you should be required to name your child either Phillip or Phyllis), there are arias from Austrian operettas and excerpts from ballets.  The Kennedy Center used to stage a similar 'survey class' each year as part of the Kirov Festival, but they haven't done that the last few years.  Bummer.\n\nTonight's performance was held in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall and featured the Strauss Symphony of America, ebullient guest conductor Sascha Gotzel, the Budapest Ballet, and a pair of ballroom dancers.  As you can see from the photo, my seat was in one of the stage boxes.  I'd never sat up here before but it's very cool and I'm definitely going to keep this in mind the next time I attend something at the Concert Hall.  It's kind of like a home plate seat at a baseball game, minus the annoying netting.  You're right on top of the orchestra and you can't see much of the rest of the crowd, so it's like they're performing just for you.  Plus from that vantage point you can really see musicians' technique and the conductor's facial expressions (*<em>cough</em>* not to mention having a great view of the soprano's cleavage and the dancers' legs *<em>cough</em>*).\n\nI really enjoyed this concert.  It was light and joyous and lively and it had a great mix of performance pieces.  The part where the conductor conducts the audience's applause during the 'Blue Danube' encore might seem a bit cheesy or contrived, but it's actually quite fun.  The New Year's Concert/Salute to Vienna is certainly worth keeping in mind when next January rolls around, especially if you can luck into getting a seat in Box 60 like I did.

In the first place, she was one of the most beautiful woman I have EVER seen.  Additionally, the two performed splendidly.  Everything about the evening, the orchestra, the conductor, the opera singers, the Budapest Ballet performers, the dancers and, of course, my date, were wonderful."}]},

The canal contains 36 locks and encompasses a total elevation differential of approximately 565 ft. (169 m). First proposed in 1807, it was under construction from 1817 to 1825 and officially opened on October 26, 1825.\n \nIt was the first transportation system between the eastern seaboard (New York City) and the western interior (Great Lakes) of the United States that did not require portage, was faster than carts pulled by draft animals, and cut transport costs by about 95%. The canal fostered a population surge in western New York State, opened regions farther west to settlement, and helped New York City become the chief U.S. port. It was enlarged between 1834 and 1862. In 1918, the enlarged canal was replaced by the larger New York State Barge Canal.\n \nToday, it is part of the New York State Canal System. In 2000 the United States Congress designated the Erie Canalway National Heritage Corridor to recognize the national significance of the canal system as the most successful and influential human-built waterway and one of the most important works of civil engineering and construction in North America. Mainly used by recreational watercraft in the recent past, the canal saw an upsurge in commercial traffic in 2008.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erie_Canal</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>","userTags":[""],"machineTags":[{"tag":"arbor","confidence":0.699},{"tag":"creek","confidence":0.593},{"tag":"forest","confidence":0.873},{"tag":"garden","confidence":0.725},{"tag":"green","confidence":0.597},{"tag":"landscape","confidence":0.873},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.919},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.973},{"tag":"park","confidence":0.516},{"tag":"path","confidence":0.879},{"tag":"pinetum","confidence":0.75},{"tag":"plant","confidence":0.919},{"tag":"trail","confidence":0.742},{"tag":"tree","confidence":0.919},{"tag":"walkway","confidence":0.636},{"tag":"water","confidence":0.593},{"tag":"yard","confidence":0.937}],"geo":{"longtitude":-77.234154,"latitude":43.065925,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75683070@N00/7992740068/","downloadUrl":"http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8306/7992740068_c99e2f6920.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

The present building, with a stained glass window dates from 1875. It is Grade II* listed and has been refurished over the last 5 to 10 years.\n\nTried getting it from Digbeth (which I had just done) and the markets.\n\nSt Martin's has loads of gargoyles on it. Here are few more.\n\nSt Martin's is Grade II* listed.\n\nAt least late C13 in origin and the mother church of Birmingham. Sandstone. Large with nave and aisles, new tower and spire. Repaired in late C17 and late C18. Tower and spire restored by P C Hardwick in 1835-5 and the rest of the church in 1873-5 demolished, rebuilt and enlarged by the addition of transepts and an extended east end under the direction of J A Chatwin. Restored, after bomb damage in 1956-7. Inside, 2 recumbent effigies of the C14 and one of circa 1400 in the north transept and a fourth of circa 1500 in the south chapel; also the south transept window designed by Edward Burne-Jones and made by Morris, 1875-80.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=216829&resourceID=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">St Martin's in the Bullring - Heritage Gateway</a>\n\nSpring 2011 - This area near the church is being developed once again.

I heard it all and then some. \n\nI love music of all kinds. If it's good, it's worth listening to, so don't start with the nose-up-in-the-air over your favorite genre. Believe me... good music will always find an audience. An audience of sophisticated listeners will stop to listen to any good sound... even if it isn't part of your normal repertoire.\n\nWhat is amazing is that dj's and musicians around the world know this, and they borrow from all genres to create their own personal sounds.\n\nHere in Second Life, we get the results from around the world. World music mixes with the trendy sounds of the day, and we get the sounds that we love so much.\n\nI want to thank all the dj's, musicians, club owners and event makers in SL. You guys made a holiday scene like no other.

Family and friends would be our focus, and then we'd go to a candlelight church service.\n\nWhen the kids were finally put to bed, we'd do last minute arranging of presents.  I remember the year I had to put together a backyard playfort at 1AM... oops, I had to help Santa assemble the fort.  Always, we collapse into bed and just will ourselves to sleep.\n\nThis year and last, things were different.  My kids and I don't live together any longer.  Jamie is fully in my life, this year even more than last.  And the four of us started our own new traditions.\n\nThe kids came to me after school vacation started, and we enjoyed three days of Christmas-eve like feelings.  Then last night, we celebrated Christmas.  We opened presents with the kids.  This morning, we checked out the stockings.  Danny got the movie Cars and we watched that until I took them to spend the remainder of Christmas with their mom and their family.\n\nWhen we got home, Jamie and I had the exhaustion of late Christmas day.  We had that feeling you see in A Christmas Story, where mom and dad are tuckered out on the sofa.  And it was still Christmas Eve!\n\nFrankly, I enjoyed the feeling enormously.  We went to bed, watched TV, and took a nap.  I woke to find my step-cat Casper laying on me.  He is one plump kitty, and eventually went from trying to separate Jamie and me to laying between my legs.\n\nThis is my thirty fifth photo for <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/365days\">365 Days</a>.   However you celebrate your holidays, may you always feel the relaxed joy a completed Christmas spent with those you love will give.\n\n24 December 2006","userTags":["365days","casper","cat","christmas","jamie","jamiescamera","merry christmas!","selfportrait"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"animal","confidence":0.53},{"tag":"chihuahua","confidence":0.53},{"tag":"dog","confidence":0.53},{"tag":"indoor","confidence":0.85},{"tag":"people","confidence":0.627},{"tag":"pet","confidence":0.53}],"geo":{"longtitude":-95.484908,"latitude":29.783868,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25499247@N00/332336299/","downloadUrl":"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/159/332336299_718f439b72.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[{"commentId":"750216-332336299-72157600551808169","userId":"19926758@N00","nickname":"luvhumpbacks","dateCreated":1183132092000,"content":"adorable."}]},

Kennedy Expressway is a 17.8-mile (28.65 km) long freeway that travels northwest from the Chicago Loop to O'Hare International Airport. The highway is named for the 35th U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, and conforms to the Chicago-area convention of using the somewhat misleading suffix Expressway. The Interstate 90 portion of the Kennedy is a part of the much longer I-90 (which runs 3,111.52 miles (5,007.51 km) from Boston, Massachusetts to Seattle, Washington). The Kennedy's official endpoints are the Circle Interchange with Interstate 290 (Eisenhower Expressway/Congress Parkway) and the Dan Ryan Expressway (also I-90/94) at the east end, and the O'Hare Airport terminals at the west end. The Interstate 190 portion of the Kennedy is 3.07 miles (4.94 km) long and is meant to serve airport traffic. Interstate 90 picks up the Kennedy destination and runs a further 6.29 miles (10.12 km), before joining with I-94 for the final 8.44 miles (13.58 km).[1]\n \nTraveling eastbound from O'Hare, the Kennedy interchanges with the eastern terminus of the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway (Interstate 90) and with the Tri-State Tollway (Interstate 294) at a complex junction just west of Illinois Route 171 (Cumberland Avenue). The Kennedy later merges with the southern end of the Edens Expressway (Interstate 94) at Montrose Avenue; the Kennedy (at this point both I-90 and I-94) then turns south to its junction with the Dan Ryan and Eisenhower Expressways and Congress Parkway at the Circle Interchange in downtown Chicago.\n \nWith up to 327,000 vehicles traveling on some portions of the Kennedy daily, the Kennedy and its South Side extension, the Dan Ryan, are the busiest roads in Illinois.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Expressway\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kennedy_Expressway</a>\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_...</a>","userTags":[""],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.919},{"tag":"boat","confidence":0.726},{"tag":"building complex","confidence":0.538},{"tag":"building","confidence":0.734},{"tag":"city","confidence":0.919},{"tag":"cityscape","confidence":0.782},{"tag":"harbor","confidence":0.805},{"tag":"landscape","confidence":0.544},{"tag":"marina","confidence":0.943},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.544},{"tag":"obelisk","confidence":0.627},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.966},{"tag":"river","confidence":0.544},{"tag":"skyline","confidence":0.956},{"tag":"skyscraper","confidence":0.734},{"tag":"tower","confidence":0.517},{"tag":"vehicle","confidence":0.726},{"tag":"water","confidence":0.943},{"tag":"waterfront","confidence":0.943}],"geo":{"longtitude":-87.662894,"latitude":41.90813,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75683070@N00/9181770394/","downloadUrl":"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7389/9181770394_1f2bd1a08a.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"49060048@N07","nickname":"peterfmccann","dateFavorited":1381360645000}],"comments":[]},

Having once lived in Arcadia myself, it's always nice to come back for a new look.\n\nA look at Salter Stadium, named after a retiring teacher in 1992. Salter Stadium has gone through several changes since then, including completely new bleachers, new running tracks, and Astroturf for the football field. As far as high school stadia go, this is among the best, and good enough to even host international track meets. The snow-capped peaks of the San Gabriel Mountains, including Mt. San Antonio (Mt.

On our way to Trou d'Eau Douce we cycled more through inland villages such as Sottise, Forbach, Cottage, L'esperance Trebuchet, Riviere du Rempart,  Centre de Flacq, Schoenfeld, Quatre Cocos, Palmar and Trou d'Eau Douce. On our way back we cycled along the coast going through villages such as Belle Mare, Bradeau, Roches Noires and then back inland using the Goodlands bypass road to get back to Grand Baie. I was amazed to see the inland beauty of many villages. One of my favorites is Palmar reminding me of Rodrigues island setting and also that stretch of road through Constance La Gaiete which then ends in Trou d'Eau Douce. When I saw those places i was saying to myself, living in such places of such beauty is one of many reasons why many actually never leave their villages to go and stay elsewhere! Also I wish to express that I found it the best way to see various places on a bicycle instead than in using a car - if you want to take your time, stop anywhere, take a shot, thats way more practical. No need to look for a parking! We had a great time exploring these places, we were for 12 hours on the road and did 87 Kilometres. The Mine Frire lunch and sea view at Trou d'Eau Douce at Chez Tino restaurant was awesome and gave us the energy required to cycle back home. Houses at Trou d'Eau Douce have such a magnificent view over the lagoon looking on Ile aux Cerfs! A stop at Belle Mare was relaxing. Enjoy our photo story where we take you through our journey of discovering the paradise tropical island Mauritius! -on a side note you'll also see that right in the beginning of our trip one of our friends had a flat tire which we got fixed in the cottage suburb - helpful people everywhere to give you indications.

It stretches along the lower shores of the Charleston peninsula, bordered by the Ashley and Cooper Rivers, which meet here to form Charleston harbor. Historically, it has been understood to extend from the beginning of the seawall at the site of the former Omar Shrine Temple (40-44 East Bay Street) to the intersection of what is now Murray Boulevard and King Street. The higher part of the promenade, paralleling East Battery, as the street is known south of Water Street, to the intersection of Murray Boulevard, is known as High Battery. Fort Sumter is visible from the Cooper River side (High Battery) and the point, as is Castle Pinckney, the World War II aircraft carrier USS Yorktown (CV-10), Fort Moultrie, and Sullivan's Island.\n \nFort Broughton (ca. 1735) and Fort Wilkins (during the American Revolution and War of 1812) occupied White or Oyster Point, so named because of the piles of bleached oyster shells on the point at the tip of the peninsula. In the 18th century, rocks and heavy materials were used to fortify the shore of the Cooper River on the eastern side of the peninsula. In 1838, this area of the Battery, known as High Battery, became a promenade. First used as a public park in 1837, the area now known as White Point Garden became a place for artillery during the American Civil War.\n \nIn popular speech and in a number of unofficial guidebooks and Web sites, The Battery and White Point Garden are sometimes referred to as \"Battery Park,\" but the park and seawall promenade are not regarded by the City of Charleston as a single entity, and the term \"Battery Park\" is not an official designation.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battery_</a>(Charleston)http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License","userTags":[""],"machineTags":[{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.911},{"tag":"building","confidence":0.911},{"tag":"dwelling","confidence":0.768},{"tag":"house","confidence":0.911},{"tag":"mansion","confidence":0.615},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.902},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.986},{"tag":"plant","confidence":0.902},{"tag":"road","confidence":0.736},{"tag":"tree","confidence":0.902}],"geo":{"longtitude":-79.930483,"latitude":32.771885,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/75683070@N00/5819548265/","downloadUrl":"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2559/5819548265_f5b6f650ca.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

The glacier is situated on the eastern cliffs of Mount Moran and is easily seen from Jackson Hole. The shape of the glacier led to the naming as the uppermost section of the glacier is long and narrow and then broadens abruptly more than halfway down the mountain into a larger area, giving it the shape of a skillet or frying pan. The glacier is one of twelve that remain in Grand Teton National Park and one of five glaciers located on Mount Moran. Mountain climbers consider the Skillet Glacier route to be the fastest and one of the easiest ways to climb Mount Moran, and was the route taken when the peak was first climbed in 1922, though it is rarely used in late summer due to poor footing.

Founded in 1879 near several very lucrative mines, Tombstone grew rapidly from dozens of people in 1879, to thousands in 1880, peaking at close to 15,000 in 1881.  Located in the rugged far southeast corner of the Arizona Territory, Tombstone was a wild and lawless city, and home of Wyatt Earp and the Shootout at the OK Corral.  But by the mid-1880's, the mines were largely played out, and became flooded with water, and Tombstone began to fade away.\n\nBut it never really died off.  Despite the closures of the mines and devastating fires, several hundred people remained, and Tombstone remained the county seat and center of activity for the region for many decades.  As the mystique and allure of the 'Old West' grew in popular culture grew, Tombstone seized on the opportunity and turned the town into somewhat of an amusement park, and now draws close to half a million visitors per year.\n\nThe downtown district has been restored into a 'wild west' main street, with dozens of tourist shops and trinket stores.  There are several restaurants and saloons and dinner theaters, and on the edge of town you can tour the mines.  Actors dressed up in costume roaming the streets, and hold reenactments and shootouts several times a day.  All pure tourist kitsch, of course - the type of place where you can get your 'old time' black and white portrait taken in period dress, then head over to buy fudge and hot dogs and little shot glasses with Tombstone etched in the side.  Don't get me wrong - it's fun for the whole family with an entire day's worth of entertainment, but don't go expecting some authentic western experience.\n\nI passed through on New Year's Eve 2007, with a limited amount of time available because I was driving to California that day, so it was just a quick visit and a taste of what was available.  Furthermore, I was coming down with a particularly nasty case of the flu, starting out the day in okay shape but heading downhill rapidly, so I wasn't in the mood for big-crowd-type of events.\n\nHere's what I did do in Tombstone:  I perused the downtown historic district for a while, then headed over to the former county courthouse (which serves as a museum).  On a bend in the highway out of town is an abandoned tourist trap called 'Wyatt Earp's Old Tombstone' - a mini-reproduction western town now faded and falling to pieces.  And finally, on the outskirts of town is the famous Boot Hill, one of the most notorious cemeteries in the West.\n\nIf I had more time, there were plenty more attractions to visit.  But with the effects of the flu dragging me down and many miles of road ahead of me, I left Tombstone early, and headed west to a stop at nearby <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/matthigh/sets/72157608464246434/\">Fairbank</a>, a REAL abandoned ghost town just a few miles away.\n\nPicture taken December 31, 2007.

They are found in both the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, but are more numerous in the latter. There are four species in the Americas while two exist in the Old World. A group of flamingos is called a \"pat\" or a colony.\n\nFlamingos filter-feed on brine shrimp. Their oddly-shaped beaks are specially adapted to separate mud and silt from the food they consume, and are uniquely used upside-down. The filtering of food items is assisted by hairy structures called lamellae which line the mandibles, and the large rough-surfaced tongue. The color of the flamingo does not arise, however, as a result of the shrimp it eats but rather the blue-green algae in its diet. (Despite the name \"blue-green algae\", as well as containing chlorophyll, is rich in blue and red pigments, so its 'blue' is often red, violet, brown and even orange).\n\nFlamingos frequently stand on one leg. The reason for this behavior is not fully known. One common theory is that tucking one leg beneath the body may conserve body heat, but this has not been proven. It is often suggested that this is done in part to keep the legs from getting wet, and in part to conserve body heat and energy. In addition to standing in the water, flamingos may stamp their webbed feet in the mud to stir up food from the bottom.\n\n**\nThe Bronx Zoo, located within the Bronx Park, is the largest metropolitan zoo in the United States, comprising 265 acres of parklands and naturalistic habitats and home to over 4,000 animals.  Focused on conservation, it opened on November 8, 1899, with 22 exhibits, 843 animals.  The zoo's origins date back to 1895, with the establishment of the New York Zoological Society (NYZS), renamed Wild Conservation Society (WCS) in 1993.  Only the outer structure of the World of Reptiles remains much as it was in 1899.  With the 1941 opening of African Plains, the Bronx Zoo was one of the first U.S. zoos to move away from cages and exhibit animals in naturalistic habitats.","userTags":["animal planet","bronx","bronx park","bronx zoo","flamingo","flamingos","gothamist","landmark","new york","new york city","new york city landmarks preservation commission","new york zoological park","new york zoological society","ny","nyc","nyclpc","nyzs","park","wcs","wild conservation society","zoo"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"animal","confidence":0.82},{"tag":"bird","confidence":0.82},{"tag":"fishing","confidence":0.536},{"tag":"flamingo","confidence":0.82},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.976},{"tag":"sport","confidence":0.537},{"tag":"water sport","confidence":0.537},{"tag":"water","confidence":0.527}],"geo":{"longtitude":-73.87943,"latitude":40.853593,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/70323761@N00/469819175/","downloadUrl":"http://farm1.staticflickr.com/205/469819175_577620a2be.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"7778386@N07","nickname":"CharlesSF","dateFavorited":1190149385000}],"comments":[{"commentId":"1713009-469819175-72157600123646206","userId":"88043966@N00","nickname":"mellowyellowkat41","dateCreated":1177468181000,"content":"Very cool"},{"commentId":"1713009-469819175-72157602073149565","userId":"7778386@N07","nickname":"CharlesSF","dateCreated":1190149383000,"content":"Please consider posting this image, and any other applicable images, to the Zoos of The State of New York group.

All men and  women  attend church but have to sit separately . Women cover their body during prayers . This is because  the mind is not distracted.  They can  wear what ever they want , no obligation . Yet ,  wearing shorts and sexy clothes during prayers is considered irrespecutful in the society  .

All men and  women  attend church but have to sit separately . Women cover their body during prayers . This is because  the mind is not distracted.  They can  wear what ever they want , no obligation . Yet ,  wearing shorts and sexy clothes during prayers is considered irrespecutful in the society  .

Described by its operators as an observation wheel, it reaches 42 stories high, with a total height of 165 m (541 ft), and is 5 m (16 ft) taller than the Star of Nanchang and 30 m (98 ft) taller than the London Eye.\n\nLocated in Singapore, on the southeast tip of the Marina Centre reclaimed land, it comprises a 150 m (492 ft) diameter wheel, built over a three-story terminal building which houses shops, bars and restaurants, and offers broad views of the city centre and beyond to about 45 km (28 mi), including the Indonesian islands of Batam and Bintan, as well as Johor, Malaysia.\n\nThe final capsule was installed on 2 October 2007, the wheel started rotating on 11 February 2008 and it officially opened to the public on 1 March 2008. Tickets for rides on the first 3 nights were sold out for S$8,888 (US$6,271), an auspicious number in Chinese culture. The grand opening for the Flyer was held on 15 April 2008.\n\nEach of the 28 air-conditioned capsules is capable of holding 28 passengers, and a complete rotation of the wheel takes approximately 37 minutes. Initially rotating in a counter-clockwise direction when viewed from Marina Centre, its direction was changed on 4 August 2008 under the advice of Feng shui masters.\n\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Flyer\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Flyer</a>","userTags":["2010","activities","asia's","attraction","bay","beyond","breathtaking","capsules","centre","christmas","city","decoration","facilities","feng","ferris","flickrdiamond","flyer","iconic","island","lights","marina","merry","most","new","orchard","our","panoramic","provide","range","restaurants","road","shopping","shops","shui","singapore","tallest","tree","views","visible","visitor","wheel","wide","world","xmas","year"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"abstract","confidence":0.712},{"tag":"amusement park","confidence":0.746},{"tag":"architecture","confidence":0.502},{"tag":"art","confidence":0.711},{"tag":"blue","confidence":0.973},{"tag":"blur","confidence":0.732},{"tag":"bright","confidence":0.508},{"tag":"chromatic","confidence":0.531},{"tag":"curve","confidence":0.548},{"tag":"ferris wheel","confidence":0.746},{"tag":"indigo","confidence":0.954},{"tag":"indoor","confidence":0.548},{"tag":"light painting","confidence":0.711},{"tag":"neon light","confidence":0.806},{"tag":"night","confidence":0.654},{"tag":"purple","confidence":0.954},{"tag":"rainbow","confidence":0.656},{"tag":"tower","confidence":0.502}],"geo":{"longtitude":103.853256,"latitude":1.293779,"accuracy":16},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/25509772@N00/5189098131/","downloadUrl":"http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1307/5189098131_71208b2692.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[{"userId":"125768867@N04","nickname":"jospedro_cordeiro","dateFavorited":1418503516000},{"userId":"96981888@N02","nickname":"jospedrocordeiro","dateFavorited":1387718671000},{"userId":"14537327@N06","nickname":"jmviade","dateFavorited":1326194239000},{"userId":"25305309@N03","nickname":"Rosita So Image","dateFavorited":1325191593000},{"userId":"56898669@N02","nickname":"purchaq","dateFavorited":1293177743000},{"userId":"45941580@N06","nickname":"jetrated","dateFavorited":1291072839000},{"userId":"36087592@N04","nickname":"walter78","dateFavorited":1290963311000},{"userId":"24308948@N04","nickname":"seattlerayhutch45","dateFavorited":1290702114000},{"userId":"38758245@N03","nickname":"ALEXANDRE SAMPAIO","dateFavorited":1290610894000},{"userId":"33896421@N08","nickname":"tokek_junior","dateFavorited":1290605443000},{"userId":"51953816@N00","nickname":"larigan.","dateFavorited":1290451261000},{"userId":"30615567@N02","nickname":"Ming - chun ( very busy )","dateFavorited":1290441713000},{"userId":"27082489@N00","nickname":"Mike G.

The statue of Neptune in the northern fountain, the work of Antonio Della Bitta, was added in 1878 to make that fountain more symmetrical with La Fontana del Moro in the south.\nAt the southwest end of the piazza is the ancient 'speaking' statue of Pasquino. Erected in 1501, Romans could leave lampoons or derogatory social commentary attached to the statue.\nDuring its history, the piazza has hosted theatrical events and other ephemeral activities. From 1652 until 1866, when the festival was suppressed, it was flooded on every Saturday and Sunday in August in elaborate celebrations of the Pamphilj family. The pavement level was raised in the 19th century and the market was moved again in 1869 to the nearby Campo de' Fiori.

For further information regarding wheelchair access, please contact our Enquiries Section on 01628 507200\nLocation Information: Arnhem is in the eastern Netherlands. Oosterbeek lies 7 kilometres west of Arnhem on the road to Wageningen. From the Utrechtseweg, turn on to the Stationsweg heading for Oosterbeek Station. At the railway station, turn right on to Van Limburg Stirumweg. The entrance to the cemetery is a short distance along this road opposite the town cemetery.\nHistorical Information: Following the Normandy landings of June 1944, the Allied advance through northern Europe was extraordinarily rapid and on 11 September 1944, the Second Army entered the Netherlands just south of Eindhoven, the first Allied troops to set foot in the country since its fall in May 1940. Their next aim was to cross the Rhine before the Germans had time to reorganise after their recent setbacks, securing crossings over the rivers and canals that stood in their path at Grave, Nijmegen and Arnhem. 'Operation Market Garden' would involve the United States 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the Commonwealth 1st Airborne Division and the Polish Parachute Brigade. On 17 September 1944, the 1st Airborne Division began landing west of Arnhem, but German resistance, bad weather and problems with supplies and reinforcements led to heavy losses, and their objectives were not taken. They were forced to form a perimeter at Oosterbeek which they held stubbornly until 25 September, when it was decided to withdraw the remnants of the division across the lower Rhine. Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery contains the graves of most of those killed during the September landings, and many of those killed in later fighting in the area. There are now 1,680 Commonwealth servicemen of the Second World War buried or commemorated in the cemetery. 245 of the burials are unidentified and two casualties are commemorated by special memorials. There are also 73 Polish burials and eight Dutch graves. The three non-war graves in the cemetery were Commission employees.\nNo. of Identified Casualties: 1514","userTags":["commission","commonwealth","graves","oosterbeek","war"],"machineTags":[{"tag":"fence","confidence":0.51},{"tag":"nature","confidence":0.658},{"tag":"outdoor","confidence":0.981},{"tag":"park","confidence":0.658},{"tag":"yard","confidence":0.913}],"geo":{"longtitude":5.849361,"latitude":51.995437,"accuracy":14},"pageUrl":"http://www.flickr.com/photos/62881046@N00/1936184454/","downloadUrl":"http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2190/1936184454_797e5503a7.jpg","extension":"jpg","favorites":[],"comments":[]},

Then I got into the inner court leading to the main gate of the Taj. The eastern entrance, just in front of the main gate, opened up to the Agra marketplace alleyways. Then I went through the main gate. The famous pond invited me to follow its flow to the Taj. I cannot describe the majesty of this building.
